The HTML file of this project contains A head, body , a form and a footer.
The body contains all the written part which is almost responsive. 
The form has the display panel, numeric keys and all other operators. The numeric keys and operators have specified 
hover functionality. The zero is desgined specially with an id as it is supposed to have width more than other keys.
It has a different hover functionality too.

LOGIC PART

The form input is taken as text and onclick function is used to check the key pressed and in-built feature of html for
doing the basic addition, multiplication, subtraction and division. When C is pressed it clears the last entered value,
when AC is pressed, it clears all the values by taking "  " blank space.

DESIGN PART
The background is designed with gradient feature of our css, so as our written text. Padding, margin, padding-top,
padding-bottom, font-size, color, alignment all other features have been used in our css. 

We have a mobile named css file which acts when the max width is 457 px, this specified css works best at 320 x 320px
The site could have been made more responsive if we would have used specified grid or tables instead of a form which
complicates the toggle for me( NOT A FRONT-END EXPERT YET).

FOOTER
The footer is used by  a paragraph which has the copyright and rights statement. Managed by vh and left %, it is 
placed at 320px 320px responsive with 100% throttle.

THIS SPECIFIC PROJECT IS MADE WITHOUT USING JAVASCRIPT

HTML AND CSS ONLY CAN CREATE BREATH-TAKING DESIGNS WHEN USED SKILLFULLY AND WISELY. JAVASCRIPT ADDS MOST OF THE LOGIC OF 
THE PAGE . I AM STILL LEARNING JAVASCRIPT.
